## Just a little thoughts:

- I have chosen Next.js for the current implementation. It allows us to leverage all the perks of React, but additionally makes SEO management easier, which is important for marketing goals.

- Furthermore, I utilized the "cva" library and customized the Tailwind config to facilitate scalability in future projects.

- Animations were implemented using Framer Motion with custom styles for certain elements
